This is equivalent to \"signals_on has been true at all times in the past within the last t seconds\", or more simply, \"signals_on has been continuously on for the past t seconds\".\n- Combining these, the formula asserts that, at all times, if the ego vehicle executes a maneuver, then it must have had its turn signals on continuously for the past t seconds.\n- The variable **t** represents a time bound in seconds, and it is used as-is in the translation since no specific value is provided.\n\n**"
