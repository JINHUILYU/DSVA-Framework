This means that \"safe_distance holds until overtake_safe occurs,\" with the implication that overtake_safe will eventually become true at some future time, and until that point, safe_distance remains true.  \n\nThe entire formula asserts that, at every time point, if the ego vehicle is maintaining a safe distance, then from that time onward, it will continue to maintain a safe distance until it can perform a safe overtake. This ensures that safe distance is persistently upheld until the overtake is safely executed, without any explicit time bounds on when the overtake must occur.  \n\nThe translation approach involves:  \n1. Identifying the core operators (G, ->, U) and their meanings.  \n2. Mapping the atomic propositions to their natural language equivalents from the variable vocabulary (safe_distance = \"ego maintains a safe distance\", overtake_safe = \"ego can overtake the other vehicle safely\").  \n3. Combining these elements into a coherent sentence that reflects the temporal semantics, focusing on clarity and accuracy without introducing redundant details or intervals not present in the formula.  \n\n---\n\n**Natural Language Translation**:  \nAlways, if the ego vehicle maintains a safe distance, then it will continue to maintain that safe distance until it can safely overtake the other vehicle.",
