Breaking this down:\n- The operator `G` denotes \"Globally\" or \"Always\", meaning the condition must hold at every point in time.\n- The operator `U` is the unbounded \"Until\", indicating that the left-hand condition must hold continuously until the right-hand condition becomes true, and the right-hand condition must eventually occur.\n- The expression `~overtake_front` uses the negation operator `~`, meaning \"not overtake_front\", which translates to \"the ego vehicle does not overtake the vehicle in front\".\n- The predicate `overtaking_behind` means \"the vehicle behind the ego is overtaking the ego vehicle\".\n\nThus, the inner part `~overtake_front U overtaking_behind` means \"the ego vehicle does not overtake the vehicle in front until the vehicle behind overtakes the ego vehicle\". Applying `G` to this means that this \"until\" condition must be true at all times. In temporal logic, this implies that `overtaking_behind` must eventually occur from any starting point, and until it does, `overtake_front` must not happen. The \"always\" operator ensures that this pattern is perpetual, meaning that at every moment, the ego refrains from overtaking the front until the behind vehicle initiates an overtaking maneuver.\n\nThis formula does not include explicit time bounds, so the translation focuses on the logical and temporal relationships without specifying durations. The translation aims to reflect the safety-oriented intent, likely ensuring that the ego vehicle avoids overtaking when it is being overtaken from behind.\n\n**Natural Language Translation:**\nAlways, the ego vehicle does not overtake the vehicle in front until the vehicle behind overtakes the ego vehicle.",
