I begin by identifying the main operator: G, which means \"Always\" or \"Globally,\" indicating that the entire implication must hold at all times. Next, I analyze the implication structure: if the condition (antecedent) is true, then the consequence (consequent) must follow. The condition is a conjunction of three parts: ego_turning_left (ego vehicle is turning left), a disjunction (other_turning_right or other_on_oncoming_lane), and the negation of traffic_light_relevant (traffic light is not relevant). The disjunction means that either the other vehicle is turning right or it is on the oncoming lane. The consequence is ego_yield_other (ego yields to the other vehicle). There are no explicit time bounds (e.g., F_[a,b] or G_[a,b]) in this formula, so the translation focuses on the logical relationships without temporal intervals. I ensure the translation accurately reflects the logical connectives: \"and\" for &, \"or\" for |, \"not\" for ~, and \"if...then\" for ->.
