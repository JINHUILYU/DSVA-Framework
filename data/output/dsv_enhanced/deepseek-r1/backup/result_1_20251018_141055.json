I start by identifying the outermost operator: G, which denotes \"globally\" or \"always\" in temporal logic, meaning the enclosed condition must hold at all future time points. The inner part is an implication: in_front -> ~sudden_brake. Here, \"in_front\" is an atomic proposition representing \"Ego vehicle is in front of another vehicle\", and \"sudden_brake\" represents \"Ego vehicle brakes suddenly without a compelling reason\". The implication operator \"->\" translates to \"if...then...\" in natural language, and the negation operator \"~\" means \"not\". Thus, the subformula in_front -> ~sudden_brake means \"if the ego vehicle is in front of another vehicle, then it does not brake suddenly\". Combining this with the global operator G, the entire formula asserts that this conditional statement is true continuously over time. There are no explicit time bounds (e.g., intervals like [a,b]) or discrete steps in this formula, so I do not need to apply any time unit conversions or handle specific temporal windows. The translation approach involves directly mapping the logical structure to a natural language sentence while ensuring clarity and accuracy, following the simplification rules by avoiding redundant elements and using a canonical form.\n\nNatural Language Translation:\nAlways, if the ego vehicle is in front of another vehicle, then it does not brake suddenly.",
