The specific identifier \"sign_206\" is preserved from the formula, and while it may imply a stop sign in context (as seen in similar examples), the exact type is not specified, so \"traffic sign\" is used.\n- The right side of the implication is `G_[0,tslw](in_standstill(ego))`.\n  - `G_[0,tslw]` is a bounded global operator meaning \"globally throughout the interval [0, tslw]\", which translates to \"must remain for at least tslw duration\" in natural language, consistent with the simplification rules and example references.\n  - `in_standstill(ego)` is a unary predicate interpreted as \"the ego vehicle is in standstill\", indicating no movement.\n- The implication structure `(A -> B)` means \"if A, then B\", so the overall formula describes a conditional requirement that must always hold.
