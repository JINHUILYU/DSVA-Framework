(red_light → F_[0,t_response] vehicle_stop): If the traffic light shows red, then the vehicle must stop within t_response seconds\n2. (green_light → F vehicle_proceed): If the traffic light shows green, then the vehicle must eventually proceed (no specific time bound)\n3. ¬(red_light ∧ green_light): The traffic light cannot show both red and green simultaneously (mutual exclusion)\n\nThe time bound F_[0,t_response] indicates that the stopping response must occur within a time window from 0 to t_response seconds after the red light appears. The unbounded F operator for the green light condition means there's no specific deadline for proceeding, but it must happen eventually.\n\nThe formula ensures proper intersection behavior with traffic lights while maintaining logical consistency (lights cannot be both red and green)."
